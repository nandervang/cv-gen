# CV Generation System Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. shadcn/ui Component Excellence
Every UI component must extend shadcn/ui patterns with TypeScript safety; Components must support forwardRef, CVA variants, and accessibility; Use Radix UI primitives as foundation; Follow shadcn naming conventions and theming system; Create compound components for complex UI patterns

### II. Supabase Full-Stack Integration
Use official Supabase UI Library components for rapid development; Implement proper Row Level Security (RLS) policies for all data access; Create type-safe database models using generated Supabase types; Support real-time subscriptions with proper cleanup; Handle authentication flows with session management

### III. Performance-First Animation (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
All animations must achieve 60fps with GPU acceleration; Use Framer Motion for complex interactions, CSS for micro-interactions; Implement prefers-reduced-motion accessibility support; Optimize re-renders with proper React patterns; Clean up animation listeners and observers

### IV. Type-Safe Development
TypeScript strict mode enforced throughout codebase; Generate and use Supabase database types; Create proper interfaces for all component props and API responses; Implement runtime validation with Zod schemas; No any types allowed in production code

### V. Accessibility & User Experience
WCAG 2.1 AA compliance mandatory for all components; Proper keyboard navigation and focus management; Screen reader support with ARIA labels and announcements; Responsive design with mobile-first approach; Error boundaries and loading states for all async operations
