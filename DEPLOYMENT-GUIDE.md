# CV Generation API - Deployment Guide

## Overview
This CV Generation API is now ready for production deployment with proper PDF generation capabilities. The system has been updated to handle PDF generation correctly in both local development and production environments.

## Key Fixes Made

### 1. PDF Generation Error Handling
- **Issue**: PDF generation was falling back to HTML in all error cases
- **Fix**: Now only falls back to HTML during local development (when Puppeteer/Chromium can't execute)
- **Production**: Returns proper error response if PDF generation fails, allowing for debugging and proper error handling

### 2. Local Development vs Production
- **Local Dev**: Uses HTML fallback when PDF generation fails (ENOEXEC error)
- **Production**: Attempts PDF generation and returns error if it fails, ensuring proper functionality

### 3. Dependencies
All required dependencies are properly configured:
- `puppeteer`: For PDF generation
- `@sparticuz/chromium`: Netlify-compatible Chromium binary
- Both are in `package.json` and `netlify.toml` external modules

## Deployment Configuration

### netlify.toml Settings
```toml
[build.environment]
  NODE_VERSION = "20"
  PUPPETEER_SKIP_CHROMIUM_DOWNLOAD = "true"

[functions]
  external_node_modules = ["puppeteer", "@sparticuz/chromium"]
  node_bundler = "esbuild"
```

### Required Environment Variables
Make sure these are set in your Netlify dashboard:
- `CV_API_KEY`: Your API key for protected endpoints
- `VITE_CV_API_KEY`: Public API key (if needed)
- `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`: Your Supabase project URL
- `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`: Your Supabase anon key

## Testing PDF Generation

### Local Development
```bash
# Will fall back to HTML (expected behavior)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8888/api \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"personalInfo":{"name":"Test User","title":"Developer"},"format":"pdf"}'
```

### Production Testing
```bash
# Should generate actual PDF
curl -X POST https://your-app.netlify.app/api \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"personalInfo":{"name":"Test User","title":"Developer"},"format":"pdf"}'
```

## API Response Formats

### Successful PDF Generation
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "fileUrl": "data:application/pdf;base64,JVBERi0xLjQ...",
    "format": "pdf",
    "generatedAt": "2024-10-17T10:00:00.000Z",
    "template": "andervang-consulting",
    "filename": "CV_Test_User.pdf"
  }
}
```

### Local Development Fallback
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "fileUrl": "data:text/html;base64,PCFET0NUWVBFIGh0bWw+...",
    "format": "html",
    "generatedAt": "2024-10-17T10:00:00.000Z",
    "template": "andervang-consulting",
    "filename": "CV_Test_User.html",
    "note": "PDF generation not available in local development. Falling back to HTML format."
  }
}
```

### Production PDF Error
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": {
    "code": "PDF_GENERATION_FAILED",
    "message": "PDF generation failed: [specific error details]",
    "fallbackAvailable": true
  }
}
```

## Deployment Steps

1. **Commit Changes**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix PDF generation for production deployment"
   git push
   ```

2. **Deploy to Netlify**
   - Push to your connected repository
   - Netlify will automatically build and deploy
   - Check build logs for any issues

3. **Test Production PDF Generation**
   - Use the production URL in your test requests
   - Verify PDF files are generated correctly
   - Test with different payload structures

## Support

If you encounter issues with PDF generation in production:

1. Check Netlify function logs
2. Verify environment variables are set
3. Test with a minimal payload first
4. Check that chromium binary is loading correctly

The system is now production-ready with proper error handling and PDF generation capabilities!
